# CO3061_Introduction_to_AI_Assignment: N-queens problem
## Target
- Implement basic Search algorithms
- Solve the N-queens problem
## Introduce
The N-queens problem is a problem that requires placing N queens on an NxN chessboard so that there are no pairs of queens which threatens each other (queen threatens according to chess rules)
## Implement
### Depth Fist Search (DFS) approach
- State-space: All possible arrangements of a queens (0 < a < n), one per column in the leftmost a columns, with no queen attacking another.
- Actions: Add a queen to any square in the leftmost empty column such that it is not attacked by any other queen.
- Algorithms

### Breath FÃ­t Search (BrFS) approach
- State-space: All possible arrangements of a queens (0 < a < n), one per column in the leftmost a columns, with no queen attacking another.
- Actions: Add a queen to any square in the leftmost empty column such that it is not attacked by any other queen.
